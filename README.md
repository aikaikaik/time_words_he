# Time Words Hebrew
A standardization of Hebrew time phrases.
## How serious is this?
This is partly a parody of [rfc2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), but we do intend to use it practicaly and you definetly SHOULD shame those who don't complay to it.
## future reference
we SHOULD use this tool: https://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcmarkup/webservice to render the documents as html, but if that fails we could hand code and copy stuff from other generated docs.
