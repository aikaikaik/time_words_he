# Time Words Hebrew
A standardization of Hebrew time phrases.
## How serious is this?
This is partly a parody of [rfc2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), but we do intend to use it practicaly and you definetly SHOULD shame those who don't complay to it.
## formating
depending on when you see this the contents of this repo MAY or MAY NOT follow these guidelines.
The main format of the drafts and later standard be defined as [rfc7749](http://xml2rfc.ietf.org/rfc7749.html). The XML SHOULD be converted to other formats using [xml2rfc](http://xml2rfc.ietf.org). Remember to use CData for hebrew text.
